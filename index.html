              <ul>
              <li><span class="bold text-secondary">Publishing and Graphic Design </span>- My familiarity with Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and web development has gained me the role of resident Graphic Designer in the schools I have taught in, the groups I have been part of and the business I managed. At PHES I established the school's annual yearbook and published five issues. I also helped with the production of TGC's 2016 school magazine. Yearbook production has involved managing staff submitting content, producing page layouts and coordinating with printers and sponsors.
              </li>
              <li><span class="bold text-secondary">Drama and Productions </span>- I have been involved in several school productions designing sets and costumes and leading teams of students to create these.
              </li>
              <li><span class="bold text-secondary">Pastoral Care </span>- I have been form tutor to a number of form groups over the years providing pastoral care to students in years 7 to 10.
              </li>
              <li ><span class="bold text-secondary">Extracurricular Activities </span>- I have led several different extracurricular activities including photography club, school magazine, after school art and craft group and mural painting activities.</li>

              <li><span class="bold text-secondary">Music </span>- I enjoy being musical. I was a founding member of The Caribbeanz Southern Stars, the first steelpan band in New Zealand. I played double tenor, which is a fantastic instrument due to it's role playing both melody and chord parts in the line up.<br>I have also been lead singer in a covers band, 'The Frank Chickens', made up of teachers at my school in Qatar. We did covers of everything from Rock, Pop, Celtic and more. I loved our weekly practise sessions and gigs we played at many social gatherings.<br>I played flute when I was a student and was able to teach beginners flute as part of my school's extra curricular program whilst working in Qatar.<br>At home I play ukulele, arguably the happiest sound in the world and I have ambitions of learning the banjo next.

              <p>I have lived in and travelled to many places across the globe, but New Zealand is the place I call home.  I was born in Scotland and briefly lived in the Caribbean whilst immigrating to New Zealand where my family settled in 1995. My accent battles with dual nationality and I am often mistaken for Canadian, which makes for an interesting conversation point. On top of that I benefited from being part of an expatriate community in Qatar, Middle East, for close to eight years.

              I believe my international experience contributes to my friendly, outgoing, and ambitious personality. I enjoy a challenge and seize every opportunity that crosses my path. The melting pot of experiences and influences I have enjoyed has also impacted my creative interests. My eclectic tastes, from the masters of Art History to trends in pop culture, Indie Rock to Classical Opera, from fine arts to handmade crafts are all shaped by my intrepid exploration of new horizons.

              My goal is to encourage innovative thinking and an awareness of learning through creative investigation — to provide students with the information, resources, and encouragement to ask the right questions, chase the inspiration, and come up with the big ideas. I want to develop and encourage the importance of creative thought that can then be turned into inspired action.

                      In this subject students produced video work for a range of purposes and contexts - promotional videos for the school, short films and video art installation inspired by artists like Bill Viola and Tony Oursler. The aim of the course is to develop both technical skills - such as camera control, editing skills, sound engineering and lighting, as well as scripting, storyboarding and planning/managing a production project - and conceptual understanding of film by looking at a wide variety of artist models and examples.<br>I introduced the Youth International Silent Film Festival competition to my classes and was very proud to see not only 3 groups rank in the top 10 but two of our girls win second place in the 2016 competition. They were invited to the International festival in Portland and visited America for the festival and workshops in June, 2017. Since then one of these girls has gone onto take first place in the 2017 competition.

                      Reserve Group is a marketing and consultancy company dealing with mostly tourism clients. I was brought in as a junior developer but also gained experience within other areas of the company.<br>At the time I had just completed an intensive 12 week course in web development with YOOBEE School of Design. Although the shift in career, away from teaching, was sometimes a culture shock I feel I was able to employ a lot of skills from teaching to aspects of my work in the office. Likewise I feel I have been able to bring experiences from working as a web developer into my classroom and think it's important for teachers to gain industry experience for a more well rounded teaching practice.

The secondary school had been running for a few years at that point and was just about to launch it's first year 13 cohort. When I started there were no curriculum resources for the department and tools and materials were very limited. In effect I was working with a blank slate.

                      <li><span class="bold text-secondary">Budget holder</span> – Maintained budget for annual order, ‘big ticket’ items and general  department costs throughout the year.

                      <li><span class="bold text-secondary">Varied assessment</span> – Within senior examination I have experience with the Cambridge exam board, which requires shipping work to UK for assessment of an externally set question. I then facilitated the transition from Cambridge examination to Edexcel, which consisted of an internally set portfolio of work and a visiting moderator. Within junior assessment I worked closely with staff to moderate work and ensure consistent grading of student progress based on criteria that we created together in line with the  National Curriculum.</li>
                      <li><span class="bold text-secondary">Informed Reporting</span> – I ensured that school policy and department guidelines for  reporting were followed consistently. Also that parents and students were provided  with quality and quantitative information regarding their progress.</li>
                      <li><span class="bold text-secondary">Differentiated learning</span> – Due to the international nature of the school I would teach groups of students from diverse languages, academic backgrounds and levels of ability. It was important to make sure work issued was clear in delivery and would allow  all students to develop their skills.</li>
                      <li><span class="bold text-secondary">Strong subject knowledge</span> – Experienced in delivering lessons on a wide variety of  technical skills (printmaking techniques, 3D construction, textile design etc.); art theory (elements and principles of design, colour theory etc.); and subject content (art history, art appreciation).</li>
                      <li><span class="bold text-secondary">Proficient with ICT</span> – I am familiar with, and frequently use, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign in my teaching.

                      QIS is a British curriculum international school with a separate sex junior school and mix classes at senior level. I worked here for a period of 6 months, completing the academic year.<br>QIS was my first introduction to Cambridge assessment and I had to quickly learn the rules and requirements for this examination board, which I was able to do successfully.

                      SKC was my first teaching placement and definitely provided me with a strong foundation and confidence in my teaching.<br>At SKC, where each student is issued a laptop (at the time a somewhat special characteristic of the school), I learned to make best use of new technologies available to better teach my students and manage resources. This experience certainly set the tone for the rest of my teaching career and I have always sought to make sure I make best use of the technologies available.<br>Working within a school that placed emphasis on values was also very rewarding. The special character of SKC created a positive culture within the school that was a pleasure to be a part of. My experience at SKC has helped me in all of my subsequent teaching positions by providing a reminder that teaching values is as important as teaching subject content. As teachers we play a role in nurturing the schools community and culture - by leading by example, encouraging empathy and respect and guiding students in good decisions.
