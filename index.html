                        Doha, Qatar
                        I believe my work managing Inspiration Station has extended a variety of skills that make me an extremely                       valuable asset to both your school and community.
                        I founded a multi-function Art and Craft centre in Doha, Qatar offering a wide range of creative activities                         and classes for adults and children. Inspiration Station opened in September 2013 and rapidly grew in                       popularity. To see it flourish was hugely rewarding.
                        My role as manager included:
                        •   Design and creation of space – I was in charge of designing the allocation of space as well as furnishing                       to create a functional and creative facility. 
                        •   Marketing – I employed targeted marketing (such as developing contacts with newspapers and magazines,                       promoting with local schools and community groups and networking and marketing online) as well as creating a                    distinct brand identity.
                        •   Graphic designer – I extended my graphic skills and familiarity with Adobe software when creating all of                        our branding and promotion material.
                        •   Social media and online presence – As part of our marketing I set up and maintained various social                      network accounts and built our website.
                        •   Events – I organised and hosted a number of events at Inspiration Station, from custom birthday parties                         to larger handcraft markets.
                        •   Administration – I set up an online registration system for all of our classes and managed all                      administration for the centre, including a calendar of events, emailing/phoning customers, promotions and more.
                        •   Managing budget – I maintained the centre’s budget when purchasing materials, taking class fees etc.
                        •   Sourcing and managing resources – Obtaining materials in Qatar is easier said than done. Searching,                         negotiation and ingenuity is involved when stocking for class activities.
                        •   Creating and teaching lessons – I have thoroughly enjoyed creating exciting and rewarding lesson plans                      for a range of ages, abilities and interests. 
                        •   Managing staff – As the business grew I added and managed more tutors.
                        Building a Community
                        As manager of Inspiration Station I was also involved in developing a handmade community group called QatART.                       As a committee board member I was charged with various resposibilities such as administrating the groups                    finances, organising events, generating publicity material and liasing with members.</p>

(www.parkhouseschool.com)
Park House is a co-education international school with a student body of children from countries all around the globe. Key responsibilities included:
•   Curriculum development – Created dynamic schemes of work and lesson plans for the department that could cater to students from years 7-13.
•   Leadership – Provided valued support, guidance and training to staff within the department as well as acting as disciplinary and subject leader to students.
•   Budget holder – Maintained budget for annual order, ‘big ticket’ items and general department costs throughout the year. This task often required innovative resourcefulness as materials were often not available in Qatar and substitutes would need to be found.
•   Varied assessment – Within senior examination I have experience with the Cambridge exam board, which requires shipping work to UK for assessment of an externally set question.  I then facilitated the transition from Cambridge examination to Edexcel, which consisted of an internally set portfolio of work and a visiting moderator. Within junior assessment I worked closely with staff to moderate work and ensure consistent grading of student progress based on criteria that we created together in line with the National Curriculum.
•   Informed Reporting – I ensured that school policy and department guidelines for reporting were followed consistently. Also that parents and students were provided with quality and quantitative information regarding their progress.
•   Differentiated learning – Due to the international nature of the school I would teach groups of students from diverse languages, academic backgrounds and levels of ability. It was important to make sure work issued was clear in delivery and would allow all students to develop their skills.
•   Strong subject knowledge – Experienced in delivering lessons on a wide variety of technical skills (printmaking techniques, 3D construction, textile design etc.); art theory (elements and principles of design, colour theory etc.); and subject content (art history, art appreciation).
•   Proficient with ICT – I am familiar with, and frequently use, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign in my teaching. I am also confident with Excel and Word for other administration work. I am also qualified in web development.
•   Innovative lesson delivery – I pride myself on employing a variety of techniques for delivering lessons that stretch student’s abilities and confidence. Discussions and debates, group activities and challenges, experimentation and competition all help extend the creative process beyond just ‘making things’.

Classes I taught were:
•   Key Stage 3 Art and Design Technology (Year 7, 8 and 9)
•   IGCSE Art and Design (Year 10 and 11)
•   AS Level Art and Design (Year 12)
•   A Level Art and Design (Year 13)

                        <p>As a universal language art manifests itself in the world around us in so many ways. I believe developing visual literacy is incredibly important and will help open up a wealth of opportunities to students. </p><p>
                        Investigating art is a gateway to understanding the human condition, where we came from, and how we function. Understanding art not only gives students another way of connecting with the world around them, but also helps them to see their world in multiple dimensions and perspectives.</p><p>
                        I am particularly interested in the cross-pollination between the traditional definitions of fine arts, handmade crafts, performance, moving image and digital work and aim to help student expand their own definitions of what art can be. I believe it is not what you do in life but how you do it that is important. Art requires a unique way of working and thinking. I hope to open and expose students, from all playing fields, to the diversity of creative expression to be found in any arena of imagination.</p><p>
                        My goal is to encourage innovative thinking and an awareness of learning through creative investigation — to provide students with the information, resources, and encouragement to ask the right questions, chase the inspiration, and come up with the big ideas. I want to develop and encourage the importance of creative thought that can then be turned into inspired action.</p>

                        <p>
                        By definition I am a TCK (Third Culture Kid). I have lived in and travelled to many places across the globe, but New Zealand is the place I call home. I was born in Scotland and briefly lived in the Caribbean whilst immigrating to New Zealand where my family settled in 1995. My accent battles with dual nationality and I am often mistaken for Canadian, which makes for an interesting conversation point. On top of that I have benefited from being part of an expatriate community in Qatar, Middle East, between 2007 and 2013. </p><p>
                        I believe my international experience contributes to my friendly, outgoing, and ambitious personality. I enjoy a challenge and seize every opportunity that crosses my path. </p><p>
                        The melting pot of experiences and influences I have enjoyed has also impacted my artistic interests. My eclectic tastes, from the masters of Art History to trends in pop culture, from  fine arts, handmade crafts and moving image are shaped by my intrepid exploration of new horizons. </p><p>
                        I am passionate about creativity in all of its shapes and forms. Most of all I am passionate about fostering creativity in others. I love teaching and sharing ideas and feel privileged to have been able to do so much of what I love in my career so far.

                        <p><span class="bold">Travel </span>– I consider myself incredibly lucky to have benefited from a wealth of travel experience that has only whetted my appetite for more. I have fulfilled a dream to visit some of the worlds major art galleries such as Moma in New York, the Louvre in Paris, the Uf zi in Florence and more. I feel that all of this adds to life experience that helps me to become a better teacher. </p><p>
                        <span class="bold">‘Jack of all trades’</span> – I have a growing collection of skills, feeling equally confident behind a sewing machine, easel, computer, or band saw, and I’m always keen to learn more. I think it is important, especially when working in a practical subject, to remain a student and always learn new techniques for producing work. </p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Animation and Moving Image</span> – When I left secondary school there were two career paths ahead of me - Animation and teaching. I love the path I have chosen but I still dream about animation . </p>
