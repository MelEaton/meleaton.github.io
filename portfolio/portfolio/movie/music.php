  						<p>Tiersen remained relatively unknown outside France until the release 
                of his score for the acclaimed film Amélie in 2001. 
                French film director Jean-Pierre Jeunet had something 
                else in mind for the film score, but when one of his production assistants 
                put on a CD of Tiersen one day the director found it absolutely superb.</p>
                <p>Jeunet bought all of Tiersen's albums. He then made contact to see if the Breton 
                composer was interested in writing the film score for Amélie. In two weeks, 
                Tiersen composed nineteen pieces for the film and also allowed the production 
                to take anything they wanted from his other records.</p>
                <p>Amélie received great critical acclaim and was a box-office success. 
                going on to win several awards. Tiersen was also the recipient of the César Award for Best Music 
                Written for a Film, and of the World Soundtrack Academy award. The soundtrack 
                album charted in many countries, including the number one position on 
                the French Albums Chart.</p>
